BAA

<p> 
The criticism of BAA in seeking an injunction against those protesting
against flying on the basis of damage to the environment is
 unjustified.
Many of the protesters support Greenpeace which has long  protested
  against
nuclear   power the only  power station fuel that does not produce
greenhouse gases.
</p>
<p>
For fifty years in this country we have had a quarter of our
 electricity
from nuclear stations.  Six years ago (Daily Telegraph, 15 August
 2001),
Professor James Lovelock (who was made a Companion of Honour for his
services to the environment) pointed out that intelligent Greens would
 press
for the immediate building of new nuclear power stations.
</p>
<p>
Nuclear power is by far the safest method of generating electricity -
outside the Soviet Union not a single death has been caused by the
 failure
of a nuclear reactor.  Nuclear avoids the visual pollution of
 Prescott's
follies - the 300ft towers that will blight the tourist industries in
 some
of the most beautiful parts of Britain, and is a quarter of the cost of
offshore wind turbines.</p>
<p>
The public concern about nuclear waste is
 caused by
scaremongering by Greenpeace.  The total amount of high energy waste
 from
the last 50 years, all 10 tons of it, could be safely stored on an acre
 of
land, far from habitation or water.  The Prime Minister of Australia
 has
offered to take all of the UK's nuclear waste.
