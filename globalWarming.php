<h1>Global Warming </h1>
<p>Global warming is a hot topic&nbsp; and generates a great deal of hot air It  should be remembered that a significant minority of climate experts, meteorologists,  and&nbsp; glaciologists a are not convinced  that the main cause of global warming  is manmade greenhouse gases. On the other hand, the potential damage from global warming  could be catastrophic and therefore for once the much abused precautionary  principle makes sense.</p>
<p> The Archbishop of Canterbury  recently called on Christians to be aware of&nbsp;  the consequences of global warming. There is no doubt that if serious global warming takes  place it will be&nbsp; felt&nbsp; mainly&nbsp;  in poor countries such as Bangladesh,  and some of the Pacific Islands. There are various schemes to reduce the gases  produced by transport, aeroplanes, domestic heating and other&nbsp; sources but&nbsp;  Given the option of&nbsp; building  nuclear power stations or wind farms, the British public overwhelmingly chose  wind farms. The  Royal Academy of Engineering has  presented authoritative estimates of the cost of generating &ldquo;base load&rdquo;  electricity using various fuels.&nbsp;  Expressed as pence per kilowatt hour, these are &ndash; combined-cycle gas  turbine 2.2, new build nuclear (including decommissioning costs) 2.3, pulverised  coal steam plant 2.5, onshore wind&nbsp; 5.4 ,  and offshore wind 7,4. The  extra cost of wind power of&nbsp; 5p per kW hr  will be paid by the consumer. David  Bellamy the professor of botany turned environmental activist has pointed out&nbsp; that less CO2 would be produced if instead of  a subsidy for wind power the money were used to subsidise low energy light  bulbs.<br>
<br>
  At present we get 25% of our electricity from  nuclear power. Nuclear is reliable,  cheap, by far the safest method of generating power and is not subject to  terrorist interruption. To equal the output of one nuclear station  requires 2,400 wind towers 300  feet high and a large fossil fuel station as for&nbsp;  2/3 of the time wind produces no  electricity. In  November 2005 at the Royal Society a report was presented from a meeting of 150  scientists, economists and sociologists  on Britain&rsquo;s energy gap. They pointed out that nuclear fission has well known construction and operating  costs and a good safety record. They  reported that unless an early decision to build nuclear power stations were  taken there is a danger that the world wide demand for clean power might result  in a shortage of engineers to construct nuclear stations. This would lead to blackouts in the U.K. </p>
<p>Why  is&nbsp; the general public&nbsp; opposed to nuclear power? There are three factors at work here  scaremongering, lazy journalism and fears over nuclear waste.<u></u><br>
  The success  of Greenpeace scaremongering is shown by the widespread support for wind farms  (in areas that are not to be blighted by them!) and the fact that this unaccountable  organisation has an income of &pound;100 million pounds per annum. The Labour peer Lord (Peter) Melchett  when he was Director of British Greenpeace, never debated nuclear power in the  House of Lords.&nbsp; Instead he sent  agitators to the Sizewell nuclear power station&nbsp;  with signs saying &ldquo;Twinned with Chernobyl&rdquo;. Melchett  knew that the dangers of the Chernobyl  design were pointed out before construction began by Western and indeed Russian  scientists. Nuclear power caused  casualties at Chernobyl, not  because it is inherently unsafe, but because the Stalinist regime put building  a cheaper reactor before the safety of Ukrainians.&nbsp; (This is hardly surprising since Stalin  killed more Ukrainians (7 million) than Hitler killed Jews.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Political&nbsp; Greens&nbsp;  claim that nuclear power is unsafe.&nbsp;  The figures however, tell a different story.Numbers killed in  generating electricity with different fuel sources 1970-92</p>

<p><strong>* The final column shows the number of deaths suffered for    every million megawatts of electricity supplied in a year (one terawatt year). The amount of electricity generated by wind in this period    was less than one terawatt year, so a death toll for wind power is not included. This is estimated to be relatively very high.</strong></p>
<p><u>Lazy  Journalists</u> </p>
<p>All  thermal power stations use super heated steam which, if it escapes, is lethal,  and kills a few men&nbsp; ever year.&nbsp; Yet we never read&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Two  men killed by steam in Chilean power station&rdquo;</em> Recently, however, three men  were killed in a Japanese power station by super heated steam and this was  widely reported in every newspaper: the BBC made it their main news item, simply  because the station in question was nuclear powered.&nbsp; We can always rely on the BBC to give  prominence to any Greenpeace scare stories.&nbsp;  When the truth appears about a fortnight later, it gets very little  publicity because, they would say, a report that is 14 days old is not of any  interest.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Nuclear Waste</h2>
<p>There are no  technical problems with nuclear waste.&nbsp;  Unfortunately the Political Greens persuaded John Gummer to reject a  perfectly adequate disposal scheme devised by NIREX.&nbsp; In France, where 85% of electricity is nuclear  and in the USA, no one is concerned.&nbsp; When  George Bush announced that nuclear waste would be stored in the Nevada desert, Greenpeace protested but the  wind was taken out of their sails by residents of Utah who said &ldquo;We will take it&rdquo;.They&nbsp; realised that the dangers of nuclear waste  are easily contained and that the nuclear storage site would bring in money and  jobs. a <br>
    <br>
  The Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, has offered to take all Britain&rsquo;s  nuclear waste and store it safely in the Australian outback.,miles from human  habitation&nbsp; or&nbsp; water&nbsp;&nbsp;  The total amount of high energy nuclear waste produced since 1954 could  be&nbsp; stored on one acre of land with, for  extra protection, a six foot brick wall around it.&nbsp; This of course would be radioactive for  thousands of years but provided one does not go within 10 feet of it, no one  will be damaged.&nbsp; When one considers that  there are thousands of tons of rock in Cornwall, Aberdeenshire and other places  in the British Isles&nbsp; that produce the  radioactive gas Radon from the uranium that was deposited thousands of years  ago, it is clear that any concerns about nuclear waste is the result of  scaremongering. In  fact, there is no sensible reason why nuclear waste should not be disposed of  in the deep subducting regions of the oceans where tectonic forces draw all  deposits down into the magma. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  The  possibility that we will have blackouts in the United Kingdom is a real one:To close the energy gap will require  contributions from energy saving, marine technology, solar cells and even domestic wind turbines. Clearly our energy problems would be solved  if work on carbon dioxide sequestration was successful as this would enable  restrictions on coal fired power stations to be removed. Again the direct hydrogenation of CO2  to methanol would bring an energy utopia.&nbsp;At present however the only realistic alternative to the fossil fuel  used in transport (apart from more electric trains) is a hydrogen fed fuel  cell.&nbsp; The only practical way of producing  hydrogen is by electrolysis.&nbsp; It is  possible in the laboratory to produce hydrogen by the action of sunlight on  water using a titania catalyst but large scale production is unlikely before  2030. The  only realistic way to the hydrogen economy requires the immediate building of  nuclear power stations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The opposition of certain Christians to the  Uranium economy is puzzling when one considers that there could be no life at  all on Planet Earth but for the fact that the top 3,000 feet of the earth&rsquo;s  crust contains 1012 tonnes of Uranium.&nbsp; The heat from the radioactive decay of this  Uranium makes Earth habitable. Even Tony Blair has  come to realise that the only sensible course is to start building  nuclear. Now that the election is over  he needs to get off the hook on which he has impaled himself by his cynical  disregard of the national interest in promoting wind farms.</p>
<p> Any Christian should  realise that since we have the power to generate electricity from nuclear power  we have a moral obligation to use it and thus reduce our demand on oil and gas  that may be used by developing nations.  It is the unanimous opinion of all energy experts, the heads of all engineering institutions in the country that the most sensible way  forward is to start building nuclear stations immediately.<br>

<p>James Lovelock FRS who  produced the Gaia theory,and was made a Companion of Honour for his  environmental work wrote ( Daily  Telegraph on 15th August 2001,)  we need nuclear power if we are to avoid the loss of civilisation in a  greenhouse catastrophe. Greens, he says, should regard nuclear power as a  temporary bandage to be used until the harm of fossil fuel has been  remedied.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The most pressing danger at the present time is the  stockpile of plutonium in Russia.  In the economic chaos following the collapse of State Socialism this material  is poorly protected. Bin Laden would have little difficulty in bribing the  guards to obtain enough plutonium to blow up London.  The sensible solution would be for the West to buy up this plutonium and use  it, via the MOX plant, to produce green electricity.. <br>
