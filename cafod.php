CAFOD  
</h1>
<p> 
The recent march on climate change organised by CAFOD and supported by priests and nuns will have given great satisfaction to Richard Dawkins ("God is a delusion") and the anti-life lobby who claim that the church is opposed to science.
In 2001, James Lovelock, who was made a Companion of Honour for his work on the environment, pointed out that any intelligent person who was concerned about carbon dioxide emissions should start the immediate construction of nuclear power stations.  CAFOD makes no mention of this. Christians in the west with the technical ability to build nuclear stations have a moral responsibility to use nuclear power in order to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide emitted.
Pope Benedict has pointed out that we should not take an unfair share of the world's oil and other commodities.  
Sir David King FRS recently pointed out that it is unrealistic to expect that we could reach the target of 80% reduction without the use of nuclear power.  He also pointed out that we have enough fuel for the next 50 years because of the possibility of recycling.  The head of Electricité de France (EDF) expressed his desire on British television to build nuclear power stations in the UK because of course they cost much less than Prescott's follies, the 400ft towers that desecrate beautiful countryside, and only a quarter of the cost of offshore wind turbines.

Priests and nuns who want to carry banners could do so for pro-life organisations; to oppose the construction of human animal hybrids; or to protest against the closure of adoption agencies by a government who panders to the gay rights lobby.

CAFOD estimate that 150,000 lives are lost through climate change, yet if they are concerned about loss of life, they should speak out more about the scourge of malaria.  Malaria is one of the biggest killers on the planet, millions die unnecessarily because of a ban on DDT brought in by an unholy combination of the US Environment Protection Agency and political Greens like Greenpeace.  Malaria was eradicated through the developed world by the use of DDT after the Second World War, but the ban introduced around 1972 has resulted in the deaths of millions in the developing world.

Further support of those who claim that the church is anti-science was given by the presence of Father Sean McDonagh, who seems at times to be a propagandist for Greenpeace.  Father McDonagh is a voluminous writer who needs to appreciate the contribution that science can make towards solving the problems of the world.  He should spend more time protesting about the heavy toll of deaths from malaria in the absence of DDT, or the thousands of children who go blind or die from the lack of Vitamin A.  These children could be saved by Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice with a higher Vitamin A content, but Greenpeace strenuously oppose the use of Golden Rice.
