FOCUS on the ENVIRONMENT
</h1>
<p> 
In view of the serious nature of this matter, I have given references in more detail than usual. If you print it as a letter you will no doubt reduce the detail.

May I propose that you consider using it as an article. I would be pleased to adjust it to your requirements and look forward to learning this. I suggest that Universe readers would welcome an article (or even a few articles) on environmental concerns by a scientist with extensive experience to balance those of Fr. McDonagh whose manifest ignorance merely gives ammunition to enemies of the church. The Vatican has called Fr. McDonagh
"naif"; less charitable readers may be reminded of Lenin's "useful idiots".
