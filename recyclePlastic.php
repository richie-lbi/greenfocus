RECYCLING PLASTICS 
</h1>
<p> 

The plastics industry is making excellent progress in recycling. Soft drinks bottles made from PET are routinely converted into duvet fillings. 
However, if we are to meet recycling targets about 10% of scrap polymers must be recovered as energy through incineration. Modern research on combustion technology enables us to design incinerators that are virtually pollution-free. 
Much of the public mistrust of incineration, particularly the fear of dioxinsm is due to scaremongering by Greenpeace and other political agitators. In fact, there is no evidence of serious damage to health from dioxin in an incinerator run by a private company. 
It can be argued that the Greenpeace scaremongering is aimed at publicity to get funds for their other projects, one of which could lead to the deaths of thousands of children in Africa from malaria, and that the efforts of the World Health Organisation to save these children are hindered by the financial muscle of Greenpeace. 
It is not surprising that the blunder in spreading contaminated ash on the allotments occurred in Newcastle. 
Newcastle Council is controlled by the Labour party which has no effective opposition. 
Socialism and environmental damage are unfortunately linked. The nuclear disasters at Chernobyl in the USSR occurred in a Socialist state. In contrast there has never been a nuclear disaster in the free world. 
I define a "disaster" as an accident that kills more people than an accident on the A1 north of Newcastle.
